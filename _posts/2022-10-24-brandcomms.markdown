webLyzard relies on knowledge graphs as background knowledge for mapping affective knowledge to consumer brands as well as the prediction of future events to guide data-driven brand communication strategies. webLyzard processes and maps up to 100 million documents per day to a knowledge graph for the sake of classification. Here, scalable explainable machine learning on knowledge graphs is central to express classification results as they can lead to companies investing significant sums to trigger online advertisement at times deemed likely to improve their reach towards a given target audience.

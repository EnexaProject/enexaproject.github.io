DATEV processes 1.5B receipts and 40M invoices/month from over 615,000 German SMEs and public organisations. These documents need to be classified and routed to within DATEV once they have been preprocessed into filled-out forms. Explainability plays a central role in the classification of these paths to minimize errors (and hence costs) as well as to fulfill the (legal) obligation of tax consultations and other business supporting roles to check the validity of (automated) processing steps.
